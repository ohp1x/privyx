# Testing

## Layers

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` | Detectors, engine, operators, vaults, SSE, adapters |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | End-to-end engine + streaming flows |
| Property | `tests/property/` | Hypothesis property tests |

## Property Tests (Principle #13)

All streaming algorithms are property-tested against random chunk boundaries:

- `test_stream_equivalence.py` — streamed output ≡ batch output for any split.
- `test_chunk_boundaries.py` — any boundary split of a pseudonym restores.
- `test_token_stream.py` — the codec's streaming path ≡ batch `restore`, incl.
  exhaustive single-boundary coverage.

This is the guarantee that prevents regressions in the streaming hold-back
scan — the same class of bug we hit with `reasoning_content` in the prototype.

## Running

```bash
uv run pytest                     # all
uv run pytest tests/unit          # unit
uv run pytest tests/property -k stream
uv run pytest -n auto             # parallel
```

## Hypothesis

Hypothesis generates thousands of cases; failures are automatically shrunk
to minimal counterexamples. See `tests/property/` for examples.
